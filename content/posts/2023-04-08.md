The new REx Hopper leg parts (which I hinted at in an earlier post) are finally in, and they look great.

I was worried they'd be expensive, but the total cost for all three components shown here (including shipping from China) was only $312.

As for the other components, they've been 3D-printed using [Windform XT 2.0](https://www.windform.com/top-line/windform-xt-2-0/), which is supposed to have excellent mechanical properties.

Anyway, I've started my new job in Boston, whereas work on the REx Hopper is supposed to continue in Pittsburgh. As such, I'll be directing my design modifications from afar. The project is gradually being transferred into the hands of my former labmates at the REx Lab, who will be running control experiments on the robot.
