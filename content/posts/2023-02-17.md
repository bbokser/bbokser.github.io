The REx Hopper is now capable of balancing! However, it suffers from extreme oscillation at a relatively low frequency (about 8 Hz).

This looks like a controller issue--perhaps even a simple matter of gain tuning--until you look closer and slow the footage down. It's a clear case of mechanical resonance--notice how much the leg flexes back and forth.

Unfortunately, I designed this leg with excessive focus on machining cost and ease of assembly, which led to the use of cantilevered joints and the use of, in retrospect, *tiny* bearings and shoulder screws. As it turns out, what may work for a simple quadruped doesn't apply here. High bending stiffness is crucial for an inverted reaction wheel pendulum.

With that lesson learned, I am now finishing up a much improved leg design. This design will not be concerned with cost, but rather purely optimal stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio. Within reason, of course. That means "clamshelled" aluminum links (to get hollow, near-circular cross-sections, which maximize second moment of area uniformly w.r.t. cross-sectional area) and massive clevis joints.

Here's a hint at what that looks like (still a W.I.P.):

Of course, there are ways to circumvent this issue with model-based control. One can model the leg as a set of links with flexible joints. But it's best to just fix this mechanically and leave that as a last resort.
