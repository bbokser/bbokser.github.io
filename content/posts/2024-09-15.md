Okay, so we can simulate a floating point mass subject to arbitrary forces. Let's now think about what happens when it hits the ground. Assuming 100% stiff, inelastic impact, we would get the following position, velocity, and acceleration trajectories:

Notice how the acceleration at impact approaches infinity, which is impossible to simulate--it would require infinitesimal timesteps. Of course, in reality there is no such thing as a perfectly stiff and inelastic collision, but in the field of robotics we are often concerned with relatively stiff collisions which cause decelerations on the order of milliseconds or less. We would also like the ability to choose the stiffness of our collisions independent of timestep size.

One way to skirt this issue

## The Hybrid Method

## The Smooth Contact Method

## The LCP Method

# Friction
Contact simulation is actually a deep, deep rabbit hole. In this tutorial, I will only be scraping enough of the surface to provide necessary context for the rest of this series.

There are three overarching categories of methods for simulating contact.
