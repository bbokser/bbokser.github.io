title: Stable Bipedal Walking in Simulation
---

In late 2019, I designed a custom QDD gearbox. Then I designed a bipedal robot with said gearing. By early 2020 I was spending about an hour per day after work coding a controller for the bipedal robot I had designed. In that time I learned a great deal of Python, and my controls proficiency skyrocketed. Then I started grad school and had to put this project on hold for about six months. But now, over a year and a half later, I've finally achieved stable bipedal walking in simulation.

Of course, as the saying goes, simulations are doomed to succeed. Successfully transferring Python code controlling a simulated robot to an embedded real-time controller running on a real robot is a monumental task on its own--just ask [Gerardo Bledt](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339677623_Regularized_Predictive_Control_Framework_for_Robust_Dynamic_Legged_Locomotion/link/5e5f8562a6fdccbeba18922a/download). In addition, I've been dealing with some sort of Bullet physics bug that causes the robot to fly into outer space, which is impeding further progress on the sim. I may have to switch to another simulator, such as RaiSim.

And another thing: I'm not entirely satisfied with Spryped's design. I believe many improvements can be made.
