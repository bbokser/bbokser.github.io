      <title>On the Optimal Design of Cantilever Beams (And Other Lightweight Components)</title>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the design of components that are both lightweight and strong. I&amp;rsquo;ve designed mechanical components and structures for many years through a combination of intuition, back-of-the-envelope calculations, and finite element analysis. But over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to recognize the incredible value in looking at practical problems through the lens of the fundamental underlying math. There&amp;rsquo;s actually so much insight you can gain from this sort of thing and so much more you can do with it using the right tools.</description>

      <title>The Parts Are In!</title>

      <description>The new REx Hopper leg parts (which I hinted at in an earlier post) are finally in, and they look great.
I was worried they&amp;rsquo;d be expensive, but the total cost for all three components shown here (including shipping from China) was only $312.
As for the other components, they&amp;rsquo;ve been 3D-printed using Windform XT 2.0, which is supposed to have excellent mechanical properties.
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve started my new job in Boston, whereas work on the REx Hopper is supposed to continue in Pittsburgh.</description>

      <title>A Lesson in Mechanical Resonance</title>
      <link>https://bbokser.github.io/posts/2023-02-17/</link>

      <description>The REx Hopper is now capable of balancing! However, it suffers from extreme oscillation at a relatively low frequency (about 8 Hz).
This looks like a controller issue&amp;ndash;perhaps even a simple matter of gain tuning&amp;ndash;until you look closer and slow the footage down. It&amp;rsquo;s a clear case of mechanical resonance&amp;ndash;notice how much the leg flexes back and forth.
Unfortunately, I designed this leg with excessive focus on machining cost and ease of assembly, which led to the use of cantilevered joints and the use of, in retrospect, tiny bearings and shoulder screws.</description>
