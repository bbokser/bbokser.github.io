I am currently a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Research student at Carnegie Mellon University (on-campus).

I am primarily interested in developing novel robots. I have focused on developing a deep skill set and knowledge base in robotics over the course of my careerâ€”I have designed, simulated, machined, programmed, and tested various robotic devices through undergraduate research, industry experience, and personal projects.

Robotics is highly multidisciplinary, and so is my approach to learning. I enjoy learning many aspects of robotics--mechanical design, PCB and circuitry design, control systems, embedded programming, machine learning, and more.
