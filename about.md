I am primarily interested in developing novel robots and the vast, multidisciplinary skill set required for developing them.

I enjoy mechanical design, model-based control, machine learning, PCB design, embedded programming, and more.

I am currently a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Research student at Carnegie Mellon University (on-campus).
